## 🧩 Sections Overview

### ✅ 1. Header
- Options for logo, text, and a customizable button.
- Mobile view includes **open/close toggle functionality** for better UX on small screens.

---

### 🖼 2. Hero Banner with Image + Text
- Allows uploading a full-width **banner image**.
- If text, description, or button is provided, the layout adapts to display content on one side and banner on the other.
- Fully responsive and customizable.

---

### 📢 3. Announcement Text
- A simple announcement banner.
- Settings to modify both **text content** and **background color** through the theme customizer.

---

### 🎯 4. Hotspot Section
- Displays multiple **product images**, each with interactive **hotspots**.
- Clicking a hotspot opens a **product popup** with:
  - Variant selectors (e.g., color, size)
  - Add to cart functionality
- Special logic:  
  If a user selects a product with:
  - **Color** = `Black`
  - **Size** = `M`  
  Then, an **auto-add product** (currently **Soft Winter Jacket**) is automatically added to the cart.
  - This product is configurable via the **theme customizer**.
